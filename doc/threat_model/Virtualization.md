Virtualization
==============

Tock components that share resources between multiple clients (which may be
kernel components, applications, or a mix of both) are responsible for providing
confidentiality and availability guarantees to those clients.

## Data Sharing (Confidentiality)

Kernel components with multiple clients should not share data between their
clients. Furthermore, data from a client should not end up in a capsule the
client is unaware of.

When a capsule with multiple clients is given a buffer by one of those clients,
it must do one of the following:

1. Avoid sharing the buffer with any other kernel code. Return the buffer to the
   same client.

1. Only share the buffer downwards, to lower-level components. For example, a
   capsule providing virtualized access to a piece of hardware may pass the
   buffer to the driver for that hardware.

1. Wipe the buffer before sharing it with another client.

## Fairness (Availability)

Tock components do not need to guarantee fairness between clients. For example,
a UART virtualization layer may allow capsules/apps using large buffers to see
higher throughputs than capsules/apps using small buffers. However, components
should prevent starvation when the semantics of the operation allow it. For the
UART example, this means using round-robin scheduling rather than preferring
lower-numbered clients.

When it is not possible to prevent starvation — such as shared resources that
may be locked for indefinite amounts of time — then components have two
options:

1. Allow resource reservations on a first-come, first-served basis. This is
   essentially equivalent to allowing clients to take out unreturnable locks on
   the resources.

1. Restrict access to the API using a kernel capability (only possible for
   internal kernel APIs).

An example of an API that would allow first-come-first-served reservations is
crypto hardware with a finite number of non-sharable registers. In this case,
different apps can use different registers, but if the registers are
overcommitted then later/slower apps will be unable to reserve resources.

An example of an API that would be protected via a kernel capability is
indefinite continuous ADC sampling that blocks other ADC requests. In this case,
first-come-first-served reservations do not make sense because only one client
can be supported anyway.
