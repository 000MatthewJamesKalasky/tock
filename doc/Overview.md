% Tock Overview

Tock is a secure, embedded operating system for Cortex-M microcontrollers.
While it could potentially be ported to other architectures, its current
design and implementation assumes a Cortex-M that has a memory protection
unit (MPU). Systems without an MPU cannot simultaneously support untrusted
processes and retain Tock's safety and security properties. The Tock
kernel and its extensions (called *capsules*) are written in Rust.

Tock can run multiple, independent untrusted processes written in
any language. The number of processes Tock can simultaneously support
is constrained by MCU flash and RAM. The Tock scheduler is preemptive and
uses a round-robin policy. Tock uses a microkernel architecture: complex
drivers and services are often implemented as untrusted processes, which
other processes, such as applications, can invoke through inter-process
commmunication (IPC).

This document gives an overview of Tock's architecture, the different
classes of code in Tock, the protection mechanisms it uses, and how this
structure is reflected in the software's directory structure.

# Tock Architecture

![Tock architecture](architecture.png)

The above Figure shows Tock's architecture. Code falls into one of three
categories: the *core kernel*, *capsules*, and *processes*.

The core kernel and capsules are both written in Rust. Rust is a
type-safe systems language; other documents discuss the language and
its implications to kernel design in greater detail, but the
key idea is that Rust code can't use memory differently than intended
(e.g., overflow buffers, forge pointers, or have pointers to dead
stack frames). Because these restrictions prevent many things that
an OS kernel has to do (such as access a peripheral that exists at a
memory address specified in a datasheet), the very small core kernel
is allowed to break them by using "unsafe" Rust code. Capsules,
however, cannot use unsafe features. This means that the core kernel
code is very small and carefully written, while new capsules added
to the kernel are safe code and so do not have to be trusted.

Processes can be written in any language. The kernel protects itself and
other processes from bad process code by using a hardware memory
protection unit (MPU). If a process tries to access memory it's not
allowed to, this triggers an exception. The kernel handles this exception
and kills the process.

The kernel provides four major system calls:

  * command: makes a call from the process into the kernel
  * subscribe: registers a callback in the process for an upcall from the kernel
  * allow: gives kernel access to memory in the process
  * yield: suspends process until after a callback is invoked

Every system call except yield is non-blocking. Commands that
might take a long time (such as sending a message over a UART)
return immediately and issue a callback when they complete.
The yield system call blocks the process until a callback
is invoked; userland code typically implements blocking
functions by invoking a command and then using yield to wait
until the callback completes.

The command, subscribe, and allow system calls all take a driver
ID as their first parameter. This indicates which driver in the
kernel that system call is intended for. Drivers are capsules that
implement the system call 

# Tock Memory Map

Tock is intended to run on Cortex-M microcontrollers, which have
non-volatile flash memory (for code) and RAM (for stack and data)
in a single address space. While the Cortex-M architecture specifies
a high-level layout of the address space, the exact layout of Tock
can differ from chip to chip. The layout is defined in a `layout.ld`
file in a chip's directory. This section describes Tock's layout
on the SAM4L series of Cortex-M4 microcontrollers (the application
MCU on the Firestorm and imix platforms).

Processes are isolated from each other, the kernel, and the underlying hardware
explicitly by the hardware Memory Protection Unit (MPU). The MPU limits which
memory addresses a process can access. Accesses outside of a processâ€™s permitted
region result in a fault and trap to the kernel.

Code, stored in flash, is made
accessible with a read-only memory protection region. Each process is allocated
a contiguous region of RAM. One novel aspect of a process is the presence of a
"grants" region at the top of the address space. This is memory allocated to the
process covered by a memory protection region that the process can neither read
nor write. The grant region, discussed in , is needed for the kernel to be able
to borrow memory from a process in order to ensure liveness and safety in
response to system calls.
