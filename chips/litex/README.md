LiteX SoC Peripherals
=====================

LiteX is a Migen based Core / SoC builder. It allows developers to
combine peripherals and CPUs into a custom SoC easily. One of the
supported CPUs is the VexRiscv processor described in SpinalHDL.

This crate is a collection of helpers and drivers for LiteX cores used
in generated SoCs. The following cores are supported:

- Uart
- Timer
- Led (LedChaser)
