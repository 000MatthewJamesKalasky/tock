SiFive HiFive1 RISC-V Board
=================

- https://www.sifive.com/boards/hifive1

Arduino-compatible dev board for RISC-V. This is the first release of this
board ("Rev A01").

The RISC-V core on this board only supports Machine mode. That means that this
board does not support running userland applications. It is useful for testing
RISC-V kernel code, however.
