//! Preemptive Priority Scheduler for Tock
//!
//! This scheduler allows for boards to set the priority of processes at boot,
//! and runs the highest priority process available at any point in time.
//! Kernel tasks (bottom half interrupt handling / deferred call handling)
//! always take priority over userspace processes.
//! Process priority is defined by the order the process appears in the PROCESSES
//! array. Notably, there is no need to enforce timeslices, as it is impossible
//! for a process running to not be the highest priority process at any point
//! without the process being descheduled (thanks to the check in leave_do_process()).
