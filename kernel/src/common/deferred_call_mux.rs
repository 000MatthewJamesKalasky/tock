//! Hardware-independent kernel interface for deferred calls
//!
//! This allows any struct in the kernel which implements
//! [DeferredCallMuxClient](crate::common::deferred_call_mux::DeferredCallMuxClient)
//! to set and receive deferred calls.
//!
//! These are scheduled "interrupts" in the chip scheduler.
//! They are especially important if some hardware doesn't
//! support real interrupts where they are needed, or for
//! implementing software devices that are supposed to work
//! like hardware devices.
//!
//! Usage
//! -----
//!
//! The `deferred_call_mux_clients` array size determines how many
//! [DeferredCallHandle](crate::common::deferred_call_mux::DeferredCallHandle)s
//! may be registered with the Mux.
//! When no more slots are available,
//! `deferred_call_mux.register(some_client)` will return `None`.
//!
