//! Interfaces for accessing a random number generator.
//!
//! A random number generator produces a stream of random numbers,
//! either from hardware or based on an initial seed. The
//! [RNG](trait.RNG.html) trait provides a simple, implementation
//! agnostic interface for getting new random values.
//!
//! _Randomness_: Random numbers generated by this trait MUST pass
//! standard randomness tests, such as A. Rukhin, J. Soto,
//! J. Nechvatal, M. Smid, E. Barker, S. Leigh, M. Levenson,
//! M. Vangel, D. Banks, A. Heckert, J. Dray, and S. Vo. A statistical
//! test suite for random and pseudorandom number generators for
//! cryptographic applications. Technical report, NIST, 2010. It is
//! acceptable for implementations to rely on prior verification of
//! the algorithm being used. For example, if the implementation
//! chooses to use a Fishman and Moore Linear Congruence Generator
//! (LCG) with the parameters specified in the NIST report above, it
//! does not need to re-run the tests.
//!
//! Entropy: This trait does not promise high-entropy random numbers,
//! although it MAY generate them. Implementations of this interface
//! MAY generate random numbers using techniques other than true
//! random number generation (through entropy) or cryptographically
//! secure pseudorandom number generation. Other traits, described
//! elsewhere, provide random numbers with entropy guarantees. This
//! trait MUST NOT be used for randomness needed for security or
//! cryptography. If high-entropy randomness is needed, the `Entropy`
//! trait should be used instead.
//!
//! The interface is designed to work well with random number
//! generators that may not have values ready immediately. This is
//! important when generating numbers from a low-bandwidth hardware
//! random number generator or when the RNG is virtualized among many
//! consumers.
//!
//! Random numbers are yielded to the [Client](trait.Client.html) as
//! an `Iterator` which only terminates when no more numbers are
//! currently available. Clients can request more randmoness if needed
//! and will be called again when more is available.
//!
//! # Example
//!
//! The following example is a simple capsule that prints out a random number
//! once a second using the `Alarm` and `RNG` traits.
//!
//! ```
//! struct RngTest<'a, A: Alarm > {
//!     rng: &'a RNG<'a>,
//!     alarm: &'a A
//! }
//!
//! impl<A: Alarm> RngTest<'a, A> {
//!     pub fn initialize(&self) {
//!         let interval = 1 * <A::Frequency>::frequency();
//!         let tics = self.alarm.now().wrapping_add(interval);
//!         self.alarm.set_alarm(tics);
//!     }
//! }
//!
//! impl<A: Alarm> time::Client for RngTest<'a, A> {
//!     fn fired(&self) {
//!         self.rng.get();
//!     }
//! }
//!
//! impl<A: Alarm> rng::Client for RngTest<'a, A> {
//!     fn randomness_available(&self, randomness: &mut Iterator<Item = u32>) -> rng::Continue {
//!         match randomness.next() {
//!             Some(random) => {
//!                 println!("Rand {}", random);
//!                 let interval = 1 * <A::Frequency>::frequency();
//!                 let tics = self.alarm.now().wrapping_add(interval);
//!                 self.alarm.set_alarm(tics);
//!                 rng::Continue::Done
//!             },
//!             None => rng::Continue::More
//!         }
//!     }
//! }
//! ```
