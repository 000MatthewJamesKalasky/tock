//! Interface for external interrupt controller.
//!
//! The External Interrupt Controller (EIC) allows pins to be configured as 
//! external interrupts. Each external interrupt has its own interrupt request 
//! and can be individually masked. Each external interrupt can generate an 
//! interrupt on rising or falling edge, or high or low level.  
//! Every interrupt pin can also be configured to be asynchronous, in order to 
//! wake-up the part from sleep modes where the CLK_SYNC clock has been disabled.
//!
//! A basic use case:
//! A user button is configured for falling edge trigger and async mode.

/// Enum for selecting which edge to trigger interrupts on.
